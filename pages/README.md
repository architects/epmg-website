# Your Website's pages 

Each document in this folder describes a different `Page` on your website.

For the most simple informational websites, there will be one to one relationship
between the files in this folder, and the URLs that are available on your site.

So as an example, given the following files:

```
- pages/
  - about.md
  - index.md
  - contact-us.md
  - services.md 
```

Your website will have the following URLs

- `/` URL (AKA the index) via `/index.html` using the `index.md` 
- `/about` via `/about/index.html` using `about.md`. 
- `/contact-us` via `/contact-us/index.html` using the `contact-us.md`
- `/services` via `/services/index.html` using the `services.md`

## These files are private

The content of these files will not directly get published to your website.

Instead, thing of the pages files as notes to yourself about each of the pages on your site
and what the intended purpose may be.
