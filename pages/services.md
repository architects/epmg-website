# Service Pages

The Service Pages are a good place to try and build some organice SEO traffic.

These will typically be the types of things people search for in order to find your 
website, so having content on each of these pages is a good idea.

## Dynamic Pages 

The Service Page template will be used to display different content for each of the different services you offer.

Which content will be determined by which URL gets matched by `/services/:serviceType`

Each of the entries in the [Services Content](../content/services) folder will be used to generate a unique page.
