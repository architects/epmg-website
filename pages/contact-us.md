# Contact Us Page

The Contact Us page allows the website user to contact your business via a Web based form.

## Alternate Routes

In addition to the normal `/contact` URL this page defines additional URLs that can be used
to segment the different types of users who may want to contact you and handle each type of user differently.  

The `/contact/:reason` dynamic URL will handle different types of users, for example:

### Partnership Contacts

Having a contact page specifically set up for potential partners can give you the opportunity to ask for different information than you might ask from a potential customer or lead.

### Appointment Contacts

Having a contact page specifically for people to try and set up an appointment will allow you to tailor the form for that purpose.
