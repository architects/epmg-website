Dr Yu is awonderful , understanding and very skilled physician. I have had several procedures done by him and all have been very successful in alleviating my back pain. Ive been sufffering with back issues for years and he is the first physician that has been able to relieve my significant discomfort. At one point I couldn't even stand up from a chair. He is very caring and has an absolutely wonderful bedside manner. This doctor listens and doesnt dismiss your issues as being insignificant .
